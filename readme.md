### Project Overview
This script contains a real-world stock price dataset (Amazon) collected from Yahoo Finance. I have applied three machine learning algorithms on this dataset: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

### Results
#### Logistic Regression

Random Forest performed better as it can capture more complex situations than the other two algorithms.
